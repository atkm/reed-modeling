Designing a Traffic Circle
 
 Many cities and communities have traffic circlesâ€”from large ones with many lanes in the circle (such as at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and the Victory Monument in Bangkok) to small ones with one or two lanes in the circle. Some of these traffic circles position a stop sign or a yield sign on every incoming road that gives priority to traffic already in the circle; some position a yield sign in the circle at each incoming road to give priority to incoming traffic; and some position a traffic light on each incoming road (with no right turn allowed on a red light). Other designs may also be possible.

 The goal of this problem is to use a model to determine how best to control traffic flow in, around, and out of a circle. State clearly the objective(s) you use in your model for making the optimal choice as well as the factors that affect this choice. Include a Technical Summary of not more than two double-spaced pages that explains to a Traffic Engineer how to use your model to help choose the appropriate flow-control method for any specific traffic circle. That is, summarize the conditions under which each type of traffic-control method should be used. When traffic lights are recommended, explain a method for determining how many seconds each light should remain green (which may vary according to the time of day and other factors). Illustrate how your model works with specific examples. 

Definition of Traffic Circle (from Wikipedia):
In the U.S., the term traffic circle is used where entering traffic is either controlled by stop signs, traffic signals, or is not formally controlled at all and speed of vehicles may remain unchanged. The term, roundabout, is reserved for circular flow intersections where entering traffic must yield to traffic already in device, with the intention to calm the traffic and enable the highest flow possible through the intersection along with the highest safety for pedestrians and cyclists.

Things to consider:
- # of lanes in circle
- # of entrances
- rate/traffic flow
- yield sign/traffic lights

Assumptions for model(10/27):
- capacity of the circle?
- equal amount of traffic from each entrance/exit?
- what kind of traffic: bus, car, ... tram?
- shape of the "circle". e.g. ellipse.

# Subproblems to Solve #
## Fitness Function ##
### Heat Equation ###
- Heat equations with sensible boundaries 
  1. Do we include effects of convection in the model?
- Spacial effects with in the oven--what happens when we put more than one pan in it?
- How to solve the heat equation for shapes other than a rectangle.
- Make sure heat accumulates around the corners when simulating a rectangular pan

### Heat Distribution
- Compute variance over time (perhaps after the critical time)

### Packing the Oven ###
- any good algorithm?

### Others ###
- A way to evaluate burntness (?)

## Shapes ##
- What would a good initial population be?
  - Rectangle
  - Circle
- Mutation of shapes
  - Stretching/Shrinking
  - Add sides

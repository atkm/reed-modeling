\section{Shapes}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The area is fixed to $A$. To determine the optimal shape, we use $A=1$. The effects of varying $A$ is explored separately.
  \item By the symmetry of the oven and positions of the heat sources, we may assume that an ideal shape must have the symmetry of some dihedral group. We begin with exploring shapes that have the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mutation, Area-Preserving Map, and Chaos}
In GA, mutation serves as a means of introducing new kinds of shapes that are potentially successful.
Since our goal is to compare different shapes with fixed area, we need to mutate shapes in a way such that does not alter the area.
Thus, mutation of shapes naturally require \textit{area-preserving map}.
Area-preserving map is a measure-preserving map in a two-dimensional sense, i.e. $m(L^{-1}) = m(L)$, where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure.
For example, suppose $L$ is a linear transformation.
If $\det(L) = 1$ then it is an area-preserving map; the class of such maps correspond to the special linear group $SP(2,R)$.
A typical member of $SP(2,R)$, however, does not bring about a radical change to a shape.
For example, the matrix
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta & -\sin\theta  \\
    \sin\theta & \cos\theta  
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
as a linear map corresponds to the rotation by $\theta$. 
Although this characteristic is suitable as a way of introducing slight modifications to a pre-existing shape, applications of such maps would not create an entirely new shape.
The observation motivates us to employ chaotic maps instead.
We can think of chaotic maps as having a higher mutation rate than non-chaotic maps.
Hence, we can use chaotic maps as a way of creating a random shape, which would correspond to generating a random rational number in a usual GA.
Mutations of shapes by area-preserving chaotic maps allow our GA to explore the solution space that would not be easily accessible by non-chaotic transformations.
In particular, we employ two chaotic maps: the \textbf{cat map} and \textbf{kick map}.

\subsection{The Cat Map}
We use the cat map (commonly refered to as the "Arnold's Cat Map") to mutate shapes.
Arnold's cat map is a chaotic, area-preserving map on a two-dimensional torus \citep{hilborn}.
The cat map $F$is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  F: (x,y) \mapsto (2x + y, x + y) \mbox{ (mod 1)}.
\end{equation*}
The corresponding matrix is
\begin{equation*}
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
    2 & 1  \\
    1 & 1  
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
and clearly, $\det(A) = 1$.
In order to obtain a wider variety of shapes, we parametrize the Arnold's map as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  F: (x,y) \mapsto (kx + (k-1)y, x + y) \mbox{ (mod 1)},
\end{equation*}
where $k \in \mathbb{R}$, $0 \leq k \leq 5$.
Note that the determinant of the corresponding matrix
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
    k & k-1  \\
    1 & 1  
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
is one.
Therefore, the parametrized Arnold's map is area-preserving.

  \caption{A square $A = 0.49$ (i.e. the length of each edge is 0.7). Each square consists of patches. This square, for instance, consists of 400 patches, each represented with different colors.}
  \label{fig:square}
\end{figure}
The cat map stretches and folds the domain, and as a result, it produces thin strips.
The parameter $k$ determines the thickness of the strips.
The higher the value of $k$, the thinner the strips are (Fig.~\ref{fig:catmap_demo1}).
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{catmap_1-5}

  \caption{Cat Map. left: $k=1.5$; right: $k = 3$. After one iteration. 
    Colors of the patches correspond to those in (Fig.~\ref{fig:square}).
    The one with greater $k$ tends to stretch the square to the $x$-direction, and splits the square region into thinner strips.
  }
  \label{fig:catmap_demo1}
\end{figure}

Although, $k$ can be any real number, parameters $k_0$ and its negative $-k_0$ result in effectively the same transformation, since the mapped images would be symmetric about the origin, and we take modulus 1 of the points.
Thus, we can only use $k \in \mathbb{R}^+$ without losing shapes in the solution space.
Also, the cat map would tend to stretch the unit square to the $x$-direction for greater $k$.
We will use $k \leq 10$, because, in a simulation using a limited precision, $k\geq 10$ does not give rise to appreciably different shapes (Fig.~\ref{fig:catmap_demo2}).

\begin{figure}[t]

  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{catmap_10}
  \hspace{2cm}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{catmap_30}
  \caption{Cat Map. left: $k=10$; right: $k = 30$. After one iteration. 
    Although the two images are not exactly the same, the differences seem not to be significant from a qualitative point of view.
  }
  \label{fig:catmap_demo2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Kick Map}
The other area-preserving chaotic map that we employ, the \textit{kick map}, is usually called the Chirikov's Standard Map \citep{ott}.
Qualitatively, the kick map \textit{swirls} a shape, a complementary action of the cat map, which stretches a shape into thin strips.
The kick map is defined as:
\begin{align*}
  y &\mapsto y + k \sin x \mbox{ (mod $2\pi$)} \\
  x &\mapsto x + y \mbox{ (mod $2\pi$)},
\end{align*}
where updates of $y$ and $x$ are done asyncronously ($y$ first).
The effects of the cat map is stronger for higher value of $k$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:kickmap_demo1}).

\begin{figure}[t]

  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{kickmap_05}
  \hspace{2cm}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{kickmap_3}
  \caption{The kick map. left: $k=10$; right: $k = 30$. After one iteration. 
    Although the two images are not exactly the same, the differences seem not to be significant.
  }
  \label{fig:kickmap_demo1}
\end{figure}
%
As $k$ approaches $1$, the kick map becomes more and more chaotic.
It is known that the chaotic border is 0.971635... \citep{spedia}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{kickmap_2pi}
  \hspace{2cm}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{kickmap_3pi}
  \caption{The kick map. left: $k=10$; right: $k = 30$. After one iteration. 
    Although the two images are not exactly the same, the differences seem not to be significant.
  }
  \label{fig:kickmap_demo2}
\end{figure}

Although we would like to apply the kick map to the unit square, the original kick map is a function from $[0,2\pi] \times [0,2\pi]$ to the same region.
We use the following version of the kick map whose domain and image are the unit square:
\begin{align*}
  y &\mapsto \frac{\pi + 2\pi y + k \sin (2\pi x)}{2\pi} \mbox{ (mod 1)}\\
  x &\mapsto \frac{2\pi (x + y)}{2\pi} \mbox{ (mod 1)}.
\end{align*}
In plain words, the coordinates of each point in the unit square is scaled by $2\pi$ prior to the application of the original kick map, then scale the result by $1/2\pi$.
Taking into account of the chaotic border ($k\approx 1$ in the original kick map), we take the range of $k$ to be $(0,2\pi)$.

\subsection{Generation of Random Shapes}
Iterate the unit square (Fig.~\ref{fig:square}) $0 \leq k \leq 10$ and $0 \leq k \leq 2\pi$.
In many cases, random iterations result in a chaotic shape that is apparently not suitable as a shape for the pan. 
However, the process may obtain orderly shapes such as those in Fig.~\ref{fig:order}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{random128}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{random256}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{random1280}
  \caption{Even after random iterations, a process that seem to create a chaos, orderly figures may suddenly emerge.}
  \label{fig:order}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{chaotic_shape}
  \caption{Another example of a square of area 0.64 after 128 random iterations of the cat map and kick map.
  Most of time, random iterations will create a disorderly figure.
  }
  \label{fig:chaotic}
\end{figure}

The random iteration of the cat map and kick map is a good way to generate random shapes.

\subsection{Computing the Boundary}
As we saw in the previous sections, a shape generated by chaotic maps applied to a square is not necessarily a single piece (Fig.~\ref{fig:chaotic}).
We need an algorithm that computes the boundary of a given shape in order to run heat equation simulations for these shapes.

Boundary fill also lets us compute the boundary.
For each point with the target color, if p has a neighbor with the non-target color, then it is on the boundary.

\subsection{Packing}
Packing the shape into the oven.
Use boundary fill to check the integrity of a shape.
Randomly pick a point -> Boundary fill from the init point -> If total colored area $\geq$ A (the area started with) throw away that sample (the flooded leaked outside the shape); if the shape is a bit smaller than $A$, it's ok (ok if new area $\geq 3/4 A$).

Approximate the effective area by:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item compute the center (mean over all points)
  \item consider four quadrants around the mean point
  \item for each quadrant, compute the point at the greatest distance from the origin (i.e. the mean point)
  \item the effective area is approximated by a 4-gon with the four vertices.
  \item the fitness is $A/A_{eff}$ (a rational number less than or equal to $1$.

\end{enumerate}

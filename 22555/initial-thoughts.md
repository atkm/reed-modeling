# MCM Problem A #
## Oven ##
- Width/Length = Const
- Power and Position of Heat Source
- Thermostat
- Constant temperature T-Br?
- Pan Placement
  1. Initially start with two racks, evenly spaced
  2. What are other possible placements?
- Critical Time t-c, where T-br == T-out.

## Brownie ##
- Conductivity (K-br)
- Expand?

## Pan ##
- Area = Const
- Generate shape by GA
  1. Does initial population matter?
- Material
  1. Conductivity (K-pan)

## Heat Equation ##
- du/dt = K (du^2/dx^2 + du^2/dy^2 + du^2/dz^2)
- K: Conductivity constant
- Initial condition?

## Other Thoughts ##

- If K-pan much higher than K-br, then we can ignore the time that heat conducts through K-pan

Assume:
All 3 road are of equal importance.
No car travels more than one loop around the circle.
T=time for 30 cars from one entrance to pass through the circle.
At max one car in time T can get out of the exit lane and pass back into the circle.
Total Cars passing in time T: 90 (30 from each entrance).
E1 sends 2 cars to A1, 14 cars to A2, 14 cars to A3.
E2 sends 2 cars to A1, 14 cars to A2, 14 cars to A3.
E3 sends 2 cars to A1, 14 cars to A2, 14 cars to A3.
Pathway:	Number of Cars passing through in time T:
E1 -> R1	15
R1 -> A2	14
R1 -> E2	1
E1 -> E2	15
E2 -> R2	15
E2 -> E3	1
R2 -> A3	14
R2 -> E3	1
E2 -> R3	2
